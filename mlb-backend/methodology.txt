This details the tentative methodology of this simulation
----------------------------------------------------------

1. API call to get current mlb schedule
    a. Want this split from current/past games since we don't want to simualte past games

2. At the time of the refresh, API call to get each team's current roster

3. Run simulate(Team a, Team b) for the rest of the remaining games using that roster

4. Note that we want to run step 3 ~1000 times to get an accurate projection based on large sample size

5. On the frontend, we could have a projected standings table, state postseason probabilites, and also graph postseason
    odds from the beginning of the season until the current point. (WIP)


Simulate Method (WIP!!!)
------------------------
This is mostly just preliminary ideas. Clearly, since this is where the actual projection
is made, this will be iterated on A LOT. 

    Pitching
    --------
        - Emphasis towards peripheral stats (no luck involved)
            - HR/9, K/9, BB/9, HardHit%, GB%
        - Maybe aggregate these stats in some distribution to give each pitcher
            a "rating"
    
    Hitting/Fielding
    ----------------
        - this is a little more difficult to quantify in a fair way
        - Some combination of OBP, OPS, SB, XBT% (extra bases taken),
            K%, and BA should give a good representation of offense output
        - Also incorporate Fielding percentage and defensive runs saved
        - As with pitchers, aggregate these stats to give some rating

Ratings would want to more heavily weight stats from current year (take into account small
sample size variance) and less the previous year played.
    - Maybe if G < 20 for hitters, GS < 8 for starters, G < 20 for relievers, then the
        previous year is weighted equally

With ratings for all players rostered (IGNORE players on IL), can now create a
team rating.

    1. 8 best position players given a 1x multiplier in team rating
    2. Remaining position players given a .4x multiplier (WIP)
    3. Starting pitchers 1x, Relief .8x (WIP)

Using the team ratings of the two teams, determine probability of either team
winning then RNG to determine actual winner.

Extra: 
    1. Home field advantage - simple +/- on the team's rating (similar to 538)
    2. Streaks/Morale (the human element)
        - Say two teams rated 100 but one team is 9-1 in last 10, other team is
            1-9, fair to say that statistically they might have the same odds, but
            conceptually the first team has the mental edge.
        - Regardless, should be a small difference, maybe <=2% in odds
